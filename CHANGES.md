## [Unreleased] - ReleaseDate

## [0.7.0] - 22-08-22

### Features

- required - list documents that are required to be included in the release. The list of files changed since the last release will be checked the programme exits with an error if any of the required files have not been changed since the last release.
- required-level - set a level of changes from which the required files list will be enforced. Four levels are available: breaking, feature, fix, other. The `breaking` level enforces the required files list only for breaking conventional commits. The `other` level enforces the change for all conventional commits. The feature allows a required files list to be used but not enforced for minor changes (e.g. non-code changes such as chores).
