# nextsv

Coming soon ... a utility to identify the next semantic version number for a release

Pre-requisites:

* one previous tagged release
* use semantic versioning
* use conventional commits

Successful execution returns the next semantic version based on the current release and the commits since that release was made.

```toml
nextsv = "0.3.0"
```
